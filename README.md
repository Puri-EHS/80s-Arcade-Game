Recreation of Street Fighter 1 with a twist by Kelyan, Nikil, Ben, Aarna, and Vaibhav. 
Street Fighter was first released by Capcom in 1987 and its popularity has increased as years have gone by leading 
to multiple updated versions to be released. 

Roles: 
Nikil - User Experience 
Kelyan and Ben - Architecture 
Aarna - Communication 
Viabhav - Testing

Overview: 
We are going to build Street Fighter but with a twist. The twist would be that there will be power ups that you get based on how well you are doing (how much damage you have done on the opposing player).
