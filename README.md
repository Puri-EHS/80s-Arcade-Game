- Viabhav - Testing

**Overview**: 
- Idea: We are going to build Street Fighter but with a twist. While there are mutliple versions that have been released in recent decades, we chose to recreate the original 1987 Street Fighter. The twist would be that there will be power ups that you get based on how well you are doing (how much damage you have done on the opposing player).
- Background: Street Fighter was first released by Capcom in 1987 and its popularity has increased as years have gone by leading 
to multiple updated versions to be released. 
- Movation: Across the saturated video game market, fighter games are consistenlty prevelant. Street Fighter was one of the first such fighter games, setting precedents for things like _____. Power Ups are a common feature in many games due to their capabilities to enhance games. We chose to implement Power Ups because they were not added to the original 1987 version but they can make our game more engaging. They create an additional component for the character to control and are also unique to the player selected by the user, leading to more opportunities for the user to strategize customize their experience.
